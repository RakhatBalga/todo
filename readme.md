# To-Do List App

A simple **To-Do List application** built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project focuses on practicing **core JavaScript fundamentals** and building a small application without frameworks or external libraries.

---

## Overview

The application allows users to add and remove tasks dynamically.  
All tasks are managed through a single JavaScript state and rendered to the DOM using a clear `render()` pattern.

This project intentionally avoids frameworks and data persistence to strengthen understanding of core concepts.

---

## Features

- Add new tasks via an input field
- Prevent empty tasks using `trim()` validation
- Render tasks dynamically from application state
- Delete individual tasks
- Clean and minimal UI
- No external libraries
- No localStorage
- State exists only during the session

---

## What I Practiced

This project was created to practice and understand:

- DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript
- Event handling using `addEventListener`
- Managing application state with arrays
- Rendering UI based on state changes
- Keeping a single source of truth for data
- Writing clean and readable code
- Basic project structure without frameworks

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript ES6

---

## Notes

This project is part of my JavaScript learning journey.  
The main focus is on logic, clarity, and understanding how UI updates based on state rather than on advanced features or styling.
